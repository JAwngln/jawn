            <h1>My Hero Academia</h1>
            <p>The story follows a middle school student, Izuku Midoriya, who is obsessed with the strongest (and most popular) hero, All Might. Midoriya knows everything about All Might, and it’s his dream to grow up and become a powerful hero too, so he can make sure everyone always has a smile on their face.
            There’s just one problem: Midoriya is Quirkless. But does that stop him from trying to save others, fight evil, and be the best he can possibly be? Hell no! After a run-in with All Might, Midoriya learns that, despite being born Quirkless, he can still work towards his dream of becoming the next #1 Hero..
